**One More Flip**
=========

An arduino game designed on a 8x8 matrix.
___

Initially you have 32 leds on, and 32 off. The goal is to light up as many leds as posible, by fliping a line, or a column. Flip means to invert the leds of an entire line/column.

E.g. 

![flipcolumn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37237590/50056682-08f4d380-0168-11e9-9133-24fa6410bb8d.png)
![fliprow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37237590/50056683-0c885a80-0168-11e9-8f6a-d807b4d61230.png)

You play with a joystick:
* * * If you want to chose a Row, you move it on the Oy axis
* * * If you want to chose a Column, you move it on the Ox axis
* * * When you're ready to flip, click on the switch button of the joystick

Have fun!
