**One More Flip**
=========

An arduino game designed on a 8x8 matrix.
___

Initially you have some leds on, and the rest off. The goal is to light up as many leds as posible, by fliping a line, or a column. Flip means to invert the leds of an entire line/column.

E.g.

First of all, you chose the difficulty, by pressing the Reset Button. 
1. Hard, you have 15 turns
2. Medium, you have 30 turns
3. Easy, you have only 45 turns
4. Endless, you play until you light up the entire matrix

For the first 3 modes, the matrix is generated by multiple flips, so the solution is possible. However, the endless mode is generated by lightning up 32 random bits, so you don't know if the solution exists.

When you are ready, you press start by the swich of the joystick. You can press the Reset Button anytime while playing to restart a new game.

You play with a joystick:
* If you want to chose a Row, you move it on the Oy axis
* If you want to chose a Column, you move it on the Ox axis
* When you're ready to flip, click on the switch button of the joystick

The LCD will wellcome you and while playing it will tell you the item selected to flip.

Eventually, you will see your score. It's a percentage of how much leds you've just lighted up.
